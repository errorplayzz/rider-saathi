<!-- 
PLACEHOLDER FILE

This is a temporary placeholder. Replace with actual video file:
- Filename: network-impact.mp4
- Type: Abstract network/ecosystem visualization
- Duration: 15-30 seconds (seamless loop)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- Size: Under 2MB recommended
- Style: Very subtle, abstract connections, slow movement

Once replaced, the video will automatically appear as background
in the "Impact and Benefits" section.

To test without video, this file can remain as-is.
The component will gracefully handle missing video files.
