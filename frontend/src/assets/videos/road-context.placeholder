PLACEHOLDER FILE

This is a temporary placeholder. Replace with actual video file:
- Filename: road-context.mp4
- Type: Road POV / riding footage
- Duration: 10-20 seconds (seamless loop)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- Size: Under 2MB recommended
- Style: Slow motion, muted colors, subtle movement

Once replaced, the video will automatically appear as background
in the "Trusted Rider Safety Platform" section.

To test without video, this file can remain as-is.
The component will gracefully handle missing video files.
